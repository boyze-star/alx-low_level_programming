In the C programming language, preprocessor functions are not actual functions but rather directives that modify the source code before it is compiled. These directives are processed by the preprocessor, which is a part of the compiler.

Here are some commonly used preprocessor directives in C:

1. `#include`: This directive is used to include the contents of another file in the current file. It is typically used to include header files that contain function prototypes and macros.

2. `#define`: This directive is used to define a macro. Macros are preprocessor constants or functions that are expanded by the preprocessor before the compilation. They are often used for code reuse or to define constants.

3. `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`: These directives are used for conditional compilation. `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` are used to check if a macro is defined or not. If it is defined, the code between `#ifdef` and `#endif` will be included in the compilation process; otherwise, it will be skipped.

4. `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`: These directives are used for conditional compilation based on expressions that evaluate to true or false. The code between `#if` and `#endif` will be included in the compilation process if the expression evaluates to true. `#elif` is used for additional conditions, and `#else` specifies the code to be compiled when none of the previous conditions are true.

5. `#pragma`: This directive is used to provide additional instructions to the compiler. Pragmas are implementation-specific and can be used for various purposes, such as controlling optimization settings or providing platform-specific instructions.

These are just a few examples of preprocessor directives in C. The preprocessor provides a powerful mechanism to modify the source code before compilation, allowing for conditional compilation, code reuse, and other preprocessing tasks.

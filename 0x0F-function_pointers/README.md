Pointers give greatly possibilities to ‘C’ functions which we are limited to return one value.
With pointer parameters, our functions now can process actual data rather than a copy of data.
In order to modify the actual values of variables, the calling statement passes addresses to pointer parameters in a function.
In C, we cannot pass an array by value to a function.
Whereas, an array name is a pointer (address), so we just pass an array name to a function which means to pass a pointer to the array.

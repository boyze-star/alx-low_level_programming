0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings.
A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer.
When a pointer holds the address of another pointer then such type of pointer is known as pointer-to-pointer or double pointer.
C programming language allows multidimensional arrays.
An array of arrays is known as 2D array.
